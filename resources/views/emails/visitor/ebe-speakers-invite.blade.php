# Presentation file

The final presentation **file needs to be sent at the latest 48 hours before the event**, so it can be verified by our A/V team. **Please send updates via presentations@ecommerceberlin.com**

It is not possible to update the presentation or connect speaker's equipment (tablet, notebook) immediately before the occurrence due to technical reasons.

# What is the duration time of my presentation?

Each presentation lasts 20-25 minutes. If the speaker does not exceed the allocated time, each presentation will be followed by a short Q&A session. **Total time limit for the speaker on stage is 30 minutes.**

**Note: The agenda is strictly timed. Please do your best to not exceed the available time!** 

# What kind of equipment do I have on stage?

Each speaker will have a handheld or headset microphone to choose from and a remote controller - **a clicker**- to move between slides.

During the presentation, you will have a visual help - **a timer**- to help you manage remaining presentation time.
