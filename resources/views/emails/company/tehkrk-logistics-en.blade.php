## Additional recommendations

** Please take your own power extension cord / bar ** (of course we have some backup but...)

** Remember, that standard power access is only 300 Watts ** 

If you plan to use something more that, for instance, 2 laptops and TV you need to buy an extra package (3000 Watts).  If you want to consult power usage of your equipment, please contact with us.
