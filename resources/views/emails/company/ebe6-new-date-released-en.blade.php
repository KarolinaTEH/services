# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},

Due to the current COVID-19 restrictions for organizing trade fairs and conferences, as well as public concern about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, **we have decided to postpone the event until May 27th, 2021.**

We had strongly believed that we were capable of organizing the event with all applicable restrictions. Concern about a low number of people who would still attend the event in February, our commitment to prioritizing the health of attendees, as well as our care about the highest organizational standards and the overall outcome (ROI) of the event, forced us to make this decision.

Additionally, we’ve talked both to many current exhibitors and companies interested in participating as exhibitors, and they expressed their interest almost exclusively in a physical/on-site formula of our event. We know how important and fruitful face-to-face meetings are for all parties, and therefore hybrid or digital events may not live up to high E-commerce Berlin Expo standards.

In order to meet participants’ expectations, **we’d like to keep the initially proposed formula of our event. Hybrid or online versions are therefore not considered as a substitute in this case.**

In relation to the decision about postponing our main project, E-commerce Berlin Expo, until May 27th, 2021, **we have also decided to extend the deadline for submissions for the E-commerce Germany Awards until January 8th, 2021.**

We would like to thank you for your continued support and wish you all the best for the upcoming months.

We’re looking forward to seeing you in May!

Best regards,
