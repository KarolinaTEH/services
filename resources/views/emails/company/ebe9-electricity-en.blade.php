# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},

To ensure that you are almost ready to participate in the Expo, we have a gentle reminder about electricity connection to the exhibitor booth.

Are you planning to bring laptops or coffee machines to your booth? Check how much electricity connection you have. If you are going to use more than 500W or 1000W depending on your package, you will have to purchase additional power through the exhibitor platform.

The standard electric power connected to a stand is 500W (for 9 sqm stands) or 1000W (for 18 sqm stands). This amount of power is **only sufficient** to power a few laptops and a TV.

You can still order an additional electricity connection - 1000W or 3000W depending on your needs, simply click on the link below and choose electricity connection.

Please note that the **deadline of placing your order is JANUARY 17th**.
