The 9th edition of the E-commerce Berlin Expo was a resounding success, and we're thrilled to announce the upcoming edition, scheduled for **2 days, February 17 & 18, 2026** at Messe Berlin. This new location offers a larger, more dynamic space to accommodate the growing number of exhibitors and attendees.

## TUESDAY 04/03/2025

The Companies who participated in the Expo as exhibitors will gain exclusive access to purchase a space. Since you were exhibiting, you will receive a special link to the landing page. This is exclusive for you for being a part of the 9th edition, and this Early Bird round will last only 1 day.

Last but not least, everyone else will have access to the booking map, where you can hunt for leads and opportunities! 

So fasten your seatbelts and get ready. We're excited to come back on February 17 & 18, 2025, for **2 days**, and look forward to seeing you there. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
