# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},


We are still facing the impact of COVID-19 and canâ€™t predict what steps the German government and the health authorities will take, so we would like to inform you all about our next steps. 

In this regard, we at the E-commerce Berlin Expo team have decided to postpone the E-commerce Berlin Expo 2021, which was supposed to take place on the 27th of May as an onsite event.

There are several reasons for this postponement: 

Taking into account the current circumstances, which are based on the current number of people permitted to attend events (for example, indoor events are limited to 20 people at present) and uncertainty regarding the upper limit increasing, we do not expect an event with at least 3,000 people to be possible in May.

With concerns about low attendee turnout in May, we made this decision because we care about the health and safety of attendees but also about the highest organizational standards and ROI of the event.

In order to meet participants' expectations we'd like to keep the event as originally proposed, which brings us to the conclusion that it will return as an onsite event in February 2022. On top of that, we are preparing a virtual conference which will take place on May 26-27th.

**In addition, the services and obligations associated with your bookings will be carried over to the new date without additional charges.**

Please accept our sincerest gratitude for your continued support and best wishes for the coming months.


Looking forward to hearing from you,

Best regards,
