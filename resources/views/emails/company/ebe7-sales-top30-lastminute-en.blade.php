## What does the booking process look like?
 
Due to the interest exceeding the space limit, we implement a different sales model. 
 
Each subsequent pool is activated automatically after the limit of the previous pool is reached. It may happen that on the first day new, more expensive sales pools, will be activated if the previous pool will be already booked out.
 
Best regards,
