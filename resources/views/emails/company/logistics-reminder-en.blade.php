## Parking

In the standard offering (without buying additional one(s) ) you have a one parking card, which is valid from the moment of entering the EXPO area to end of the event.

The parking card will be in your "welcome pack" on your booth, and you need it **only for leaving**

If the main parking will be full we will open the parking area on the other side of the street.

## Assembly day 

* 6th of November from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM.
* 7th of November from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM.

If you want to unload your stuff and are coming by car - please use the unloading gate shown on the map.

After entering the hall you need to go to the information point for the exhibitors. Your Account Manager will await :)

At your booth, you will find a welcome pack including: 

* the badges of your representatives if you have added them before the deadline at your exhibitor's panel (if not as us for blank ones), 
* lunch vouchers, 
* contact numbers to the staff of Expo, 
* parking card
* any additionally paid vouchers, parking cards...

** During the assembly day (6th of November) the hall would not be heated, because of that, we ask you to be prepared and take warm clothes with you. **

** Please take your own power extension cord / bar ** 

** Remember, that standard power access is only 300 Watts ** 

If you plan to use something more that, for instance, 2 laptops and TV you need to buy an extra package (3000 Watts).  If you want to consult power usage of your equipment, please contact with us.

## Expo day

7th of November from 10.00 AM to 5.00 PM.

In case of any problem (e.g., with electricity) you should go to the information for exhibitors or call your Account Manager, whose number you will find in the welcome pack.

** At 5.00 PM we invite you to the networking area for a celebration. **

## Disassembly

7th of November. Disassembly is possible from 5.15 PM to 8.00 PM
