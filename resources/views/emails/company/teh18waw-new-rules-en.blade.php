# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},

We would like to update you about the situation regarding upcoming E-commerce Warsaw Expo.

The event will be held on October 23rd, at EXPO XXI in Warsaw, in a formula adapted to the current guidelines for trade fair organizers prepared by the Ministry of Development and the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate [https://targiehandlu.pl/covid19](https://targiehandlu.pl/covid19 )

Apart from the procedures that we have already got used to (hand disinfection, the obligation to cover the nose and mouth) - and in which EXPO XXI will support us - we also need to adjust the rules of participation.

## The most important changes for Exhibitors

**The number of Visitors will have to be limited to those who:**

a) register with company registration number and will be accepted by us

b) as above but will be accepted by the Exhibitor in the Exhibitor's panel earlier

c) will apply for a meeting via the Exhibitor's public profile

d) will be invited directly by the Exhibitor via Exhibitor's panel

(we are currently working on the b, c, d features - they will be available at least one month before the event)

**The number of Exhibitor's Representatives at the stand will have to be controlled.**

Maximum 2 people (for standard stands) and 4 (Grand stands) representing the Exhibitor at one time. It will be possible to change Representatives during the Event (e.g. in the middle of the event)

**It will not be possible to distribute paper materials outside the stand**

The current policy and rules of participation in the event will be updated on [https://targiehandlu.pl/covid19](https://targiehandlu.pl/covid19)

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let us know.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,

Karolina Michalak,
