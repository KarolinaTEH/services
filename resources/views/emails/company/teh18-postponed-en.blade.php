# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},

I would like to inform you about the situation regarding our E-commerce Expo planned for April in Cracow.

We would also like to apologize for the long-term uncertainty - we had to analyze the situation in many aspects.

## Brief information:

@component('mail::panel')

The next - the only one this year - Ecommerce Expo will be held **on October 23, 2020 at EXPO XXI in Warsaw**.

All **reservations of the exhibition spaces**, related to planned edition of the Ecommerce Expo in Cracow, are going to be **sustained** - without any additional payments - in Warsaw.

## Complete information:

The regulations from the Polish government (issued on March 14th and constantly tightened) prohibits any public gatherings.

After analyzing the epidemiological forecasts for probable scenarios for the development of the epidemiological situation, we came to the conclusion that any attempt to organize an event in this half-year is too risky for everyone.

Due to **99% compatibility of the expo halls in Cracow and Warsaw we are able to transfer all reservations** guaranteeing **identical exhibitors' exposure** in relation to key elements of the Expo as communication routes, networking scene, presentation scenes and the entrance. 

## Possible actions

If participation in the Expo on October 23, 2020 in Warsaw is unacceptable to you - please reply to this message. We will try to find the optimal solution.

If your accounting department requires a written confirmation of transferring fees to the edition of the Expo in a different location and date - please contact us.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,

Adam Zygadlewicz

CEO
