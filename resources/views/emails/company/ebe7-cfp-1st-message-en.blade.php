# Hello {{ array_get($profile, "fname") }},

We are excited to announce that the **E-commerce Berlin Expo - Call for Papers contest** has just started! It means that you can already submit your presentation proposal to become a speaker on one of the stages at the Event.

## Speaking at one of the most senior retail events in Germany in front of our 10000+ audience will help you grow your brand awareness, boost your personal profile and generate quality connections.

We are looking for data-driven case studies that cover the following topics:

* Tips on new technologies that really work â€“ along with practical examples

* Best practices in multi-channel

* Actionable insights on the use of data

* Examples of successful personalization and its impact on customer experience

* Cross-border opportunities and successful expansion into foreign markets

*Other practical examples of e-commerce related problems solved or successes achieved


Just a hint - **case study formulas** showing examples of cooperation between service providers and the online stores are always the most expected ones! 

The audience is not interested in listening to sales pitches, so please avoid submitting those, unless you have a great case to show.


To start your submission, please follow the button below.
